Get Started 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. If not already done, create an account on `Github`_,

#. Go to the official NoiseModelling repository: https://github.com/Universite-Gustave-Eiffel/NoiseModelling

#. There are 4 main librairies: 

    * ``noisemodelling-emission`` : to determine the noise emission from traffic (road vehicles, trains)
    * ``noisemodelling-jdbc`` : Fetch data from database, run computation then export results into the database
    * ``noisemodelling-pathfinder`` : create vertical profiles between receivers and point sources
    * ``noisemodelling-propagation`` : convert vertical profiles into propagation rays and compute cnossos attenuation

#. Enjoy & feel free to contact us!
